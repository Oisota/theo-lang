# Theo

Theo is a general purpose, statically typed, functional programming language that aims to be simple and easy to learn while still being powerful enough to do most things.

Design goals include:
- static typing and type inference
- compile to standalone executables
- high level
- simple, consistent, easy to learn

Influenced by:
- Python (simplicity, module system)
- Rust (curly brace syntax, struct/enum type syntax, ADTs, expression based)
- Nim (compile to C source code)
- Go (import syntax, compile to standalone binaries)
- Gleam (pub access modifier syntax, only case expressions, expression based)

Docs are all under `./doc` directory and can be built  with [mdbook](https://github.com/rust-lang/mdBook).
