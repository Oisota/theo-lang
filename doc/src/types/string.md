# String

Strings can be created by wrapping text in quotes.
Need to consider how they should be implemented.
Are they just a `List[char]` or something else?
Do we consider strings primitive since they have a literal syntax or are they a collection type?
Little of both probably.

```
let s = "Hello, World!"
```
