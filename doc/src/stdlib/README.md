# Core Modules

These are the core modules that will be available:
## Core Data Type Modules
- Function
- Int
- Float
- Bool
- Char
- String
- Collections
	- List
	- Vector
	- Dict
	- Set
- Mut
- Option
- Result

## Other Modules
- math
- io
- regex
- file
- os
- sys
- crypto
- socket
- http
- concurrency

Not sure if excluding all modules by default is a good idea.
Types like `Option`, `Result`, `Mut`, `Bool`, etc are going to be very commonly used and it might get annoying to have something like this in every file:
```
import (
	"std/option" *
	"std/result" *
	"std/mut" *
	"std/bool" *
)
```
Or at the very least include a `common` module that would include/export all the other types.
```
import (
	"std/common" *
)
```

Seems like the usual approach here is to have a 'prelude' module that gets imported automatically into every module.
It would contain all the commonly used types already exported to the top level scope.

I think the `common` module might be a good middle ground in that you still are being explicit with what is imported while still getting all the basic types imported easily.
